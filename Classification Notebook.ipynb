    "We have been tasked with creating a classification model using Python and deploying it as a web application with Streamlit by a news outlet. The aim is to apply machine learning techniques to natural language processing tasks. This project aims to classify news articles into categories such as Business, Technology, Sports, Education, and Entertainment.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Recall: The proportion of true positives out of the total actual positives. High recall means that your model can identify most of the actual positives.\n",

    "* High Accuracy: With an accuracy of 97.55%, the model performs very well, correctly classifying the vast majority of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistency Across Classes: The high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes indicate that the model is consistent and reliable in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technology Class: While the technology class has slightly lower precision (0.93) compared to the other classes, it still maintains a high recall (0.98), meaning it correctly identifies most of the technology samples with some false positives.\n",
